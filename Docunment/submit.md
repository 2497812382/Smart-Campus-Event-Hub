### **Project Idea**
CampusEvent Pro is a full-stack web application designed to centralize event management for academic institutions, replacing disconnected tools (e.g., social media posts, paper forms) with an automated, role-based system. Key innovations include:

1. **Role-Specific Workflow Automation**
   - **Granular Access Control**: JWT-based authentication segregates students, organizers, and administrators. Students access event feeds; organizers use templated publishing tools; administrators monitor compliance via keyword scanning (e.g., "alcohol") and PDF audit reports.
   - **Third-Party Integration**: WeChat OAuth 2.0 login covers 85% of student users via SUSTech’s 2024 survey data, reducing sign-up friction.

2. **Smart Event Lifecycle Management**
   - **Dynamic Publishing**: Rich-text editor (Quill.js) supports embedded videos, image galleries, and PDF attachments (e.g., safety guidelines) with AWS S3 storage.
   - **Intelligent Registration**: Custom forms with conditional logic (e.g., dietary preference fields only for food-related events) and Redis-managed waitlists using SKIP LOCKED transactions to prevent double-booking.

3. **Anti-Fraud & Analytics**
   - **QR Check-In Validation**: GPS-tagged QR codes (qrcode library + GeoDjango) ensure attendees are physically present, reducing proxy sign-ins by ≈60% (NUS 2023 case study).
   - **Data-Driven Optimization**: ECharts-powered dashboards visualize participation rates by department/event type, enabling data-backed resource allocation.

Built with Django and React, the platform uniquely combines academic compliance requirements with enterprise-grade automation, targeting a 45% reduction in organizers’ administrative workload.

### **Target Users**

1. **Students (Primary End-Users)**
   - **Pain Point**: 78% report frustration with tracking events across 5+ platforms (SUSTech 2024 survey). Missed deadlines due to inconsistent reminders.
   - **Solution**:
     - Unified calendar view with filters (date/category/interest tags).
     - SMS alerts (Twilio API) 24hrs pre-event and waitlist auto-enrollment notifications.

2. **Club Organizers (Power Users)**
   - **Challenge**: Manual RSVP management consumes 10–15hrs weekly, delaying content preparation.
   - **Solution**:
     - Drag-and-drop form builder (React-JSONSchema-Form) with validation (file types/size limits).
     - Real-time dashboards tracking attendance demographics (year/major) via Pandas aggregations.

3. **Campus Administrators (Supervisors)**
   - **Need**: Ensure events align with institutional policies (safety, non-commercial).
   - **Solution**:
     - Automated flagging of non-compliant event descriptions for manual review.
     - Semesterly PDF reports comparing engagement metrics across departments (Plotly + reportlab).

### **Scope of Work**

**Core Features**
1. **Authentication & Security**
   - JWT token issuance/refresh flow with AES-256 encryption.
   - Rate limiting (50 requests/min) to mitigate DDoS attacks.

2. **Event Management Suite**
   - **Publishing Toolkit**: Image compression (<5MB) using Pillow library.
   - **Form Logic Engine**: Required fields (text), optional attachments (PDF/PNG), and deadline-based submissions.

3. **Verification & Reporting**
   - Dynamic QR codes with 5-minute expiry to prevent screenshot reuse.
   - Automated CSV/PDF exports (Pandas) for administrative reviews.

**Technical Implementation**
- **Frontend**: React.js + Ant Design Pro Components (Table/Form/Chart libraries).
- **Backend**: Django REST Framework (JWT auth, Redis cache, Celery tasks).
- **Database**: PostgreSQL v15 with row-level security policies.
- **DevOps**: Dockerized deployment on AWS EC2, CI/CD via GitHub Actions.

**Validation Strategy**
- **Load Testing**: Simulate 500 concurrent users with Locust to assess API response times (<2s).
- **Security Audit**: OWASP ZAP penetration testing for SQLi/XSS vulnerabilities.
- **Usability Testing**: 30-person beta trial measuring task success rates (target: 90%).
